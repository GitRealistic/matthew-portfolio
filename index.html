    <p>The image above, that of which is my favorite one that I have done so far, is a Geometric Abstraction. I designed it like this because I wanted to see what I can do with shapes. So I played around with those and then did the same with the choices of color and gradients. Basically, it turned out great.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first image you see below the heading image is a comic strip like image I created. The theme of this was just to create a random super villain or cruel monster that is heading towards a city or building to attack it. I used six panels and it turned out great indeed.</p>
  <img src="images/4.png" alt="Ocean" class="w3-image" width="1000" height="500">
    <br>
    <p>This image is supposed to be a movie poster type of design that I made. I decided to do something for Terminator 2 in this case. I could have stylized it more but it still looked very good.</p>
  <img src="images/3.png" alt="Falls" class="w3-image w3-margin-top" width="1000" height="500">
    <br>
    <p>This last image here that I made was pretty much supposed to be a logo. Honestly, I thought this was very creative on my part because I played with the shapes in a way to create the insect image. The wings were tricky but I got it to work. I am very proud of this image to be fairly honest as well. I never thought I would pull it off. I just think this was one of the harder ones that I had to make, too.</p>
